<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F42722830&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=ff7700"> </iframe>

I recorded this on my Motorola DroidX with [Tape-a-Talk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=name.markus.droesser.tapeatalk&hl=en) it was trimmed down to 3 segments and 'merged' together in [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/). I think these are some sort of Finch (brown). This might be something good to loop when you're trying to get to sleep - you caffeine addicts ;) Hope you enjoy!

p.s. thanks to [this post](http://redlegion.org/2012/03/31/Jekyll-and-youtube-embedding/), all i had to do was insert a space to fix my iframe from wacking-out Jekyll.
