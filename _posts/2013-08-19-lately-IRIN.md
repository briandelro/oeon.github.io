## Lately, as IRIN

Been on a heck of a run, doing Infrared Interpreter assignments this month - 14 days...well, make that **nights**. [IRIN](http://www.nationalfiretraining.net/catalog/detail/code/S443) is a position within the Incident Command System (ICS) for wildfire incidents. I was exposed to it as a [GIS Specialist for Incident Management](http://www.nationalfiretraining.net/catalog/detail/code/S341) (GISS) and attracted to how it combines rapid intelligence and mapping - and all their surrounding associated technologies.

When an incident (typically wildfire) needs a resource (like IRIN), the resource status and availability is queried/ordered in [ROSS](http://ross.nwcg.gov/aboutross.html). Then, under direction of the National Infrared Operations [NIROPS](http://nirops.fs.fed.us/pages/about) Unit - IRIN's around the Western U.S. work by coordination of a National Coordinator. I pilfered [this](http://www.wrightwoodfsc.com/StationFire/NIROPS_Poster_Jan2008.pdf) description:

> At PL 4, a National IR Coordinator takes over the infrared operations from
the aviation desk at NICC. This includes receiving the scanner order 
requests, making sure there are IRINs assigned to each incident, prioritizing 
the flights according to NMAC, planning the missions with the crews, flight
following, trouble-shooting along the flight, remote data uploads, acquiring
other resources and reporting accomplishments back to NICC.

Acronyms they don't teach you in the bike lane
 
- [PL][0]: The five Preparedness Levels range from I to V, with V being the highest level.   
- [NICC][1]: National Interagency Coordination Center 

Orders come in for the various [active incidents](http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/) ongoing - a flight plan is developed for the operational assests available to NIROPS - and IRIN's are assigned to one or more fires.

My workflow as an IRIN: download support data from the incident including most recent fire perimeter, fire line types, organizational work assignment locations (Divisions, Branches, etc.), review the weather. Follwing the airplanes with [AFF](https://www.aff.gov/) and the pilots via Twitter - I know when my fire has been flown and [the data](http://nirops.fs.fed.us/pages/imagery) is complete for download & interpretation. I generate a few .PDF map products, 4 shapefiles: isolated heat points & scattered/intense and heat perimeter polygons, a .KMZ and a mission log.

Infrared Interpration: a rapid and very effective use of technology to gather data & intelligence for delivery of a quality product for wildfire incident managers.
